# simple-web-scraper

This web scraper reads the comments of the Hacker News "Ask HM: Who is Hiring? (June 2024)" page (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40563283) and determines which programming languages and technologies are the most in-demand. The scraper returns the number of comments mentioning each technology and plots them on a bar graph.

I followed Pixelgami's YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew44dS0mw-E&ab_channel=pixegami

The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with web scraping and data acquisition, and to learn new technologies like BeautifulSoup and MatPlotLib.
